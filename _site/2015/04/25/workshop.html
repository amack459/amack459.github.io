<p>I really love music, and have been thinking of ways to expand on available music tech. The amount of musical spam that happens, specifically within Hip-Hop is appalling. So, I set out to produce something that helps reduce spam in the music community. This is how Studio Vibes was born, which is essentially a tinder for musicians. You’re only allowed to communicate with a musician and/or producer if there is mutual interest. This project was built with the MEAN stack, Angular Touch, Soundcloud Oauth, CSS Animate and the Soundcloud API. Studio Vibes can only be used by musicians who have a Soundcloud page. This is a form of filtering to ensure that the community consists of serious artists. Once they sign in, my API pulls their user information and stores them in my database. When an artist’s picture appears, 10 seconds of their music plays. The user browsing can then swipe right or left depending on whether or not they’re impressed with the tunes they’re hearing.</p>
